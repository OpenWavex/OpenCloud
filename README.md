## OpenCloud by Wavex ##

This project provides open source implementations of cloud services.

### Why? ###
Cloud services are too expensive. On prem is back. Or, at least you can use this to build apps using cheaper server services.

For instance, running servers in the cloud is a lot cheaper than using some serverless functions. So use this instead!

### How? ###
We install these services separately, depending on your projects needs with the install scripts in each service's folder.
These services will interact with your server the way other cloud products do, only it is YOUR server. So it provides all the benefits of
cloud products, and all the benefits of on-prem products.

- CI/CD : In Progress
- API endpoints : Planned
